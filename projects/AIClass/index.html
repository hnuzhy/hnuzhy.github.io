    <meta property="og:description" content="Over the past decades, tremendous human and financial resources have been inputted into K-12 education. In order to understand whether such investment has improved the quality and efficiency of the education, we should first solve a core problem: how to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the teaching quality. Unfortunately, up to now, this problem still highly depends on feedbacks of domain experts, which is expensive and unscalable. In this paper, we propose an automatic teaching assistance system, called AIClass, by detecting and recognizing multiple characteristics during the class, including emotion states, speech analysis, action recognition, and position tracking. AIClass not only tracks and observes the teaching styles, but also comprehensively grasps the learning states of students. These structured analysis results could be mapped into the current curriculum observation schemes, and further realize the automatic and large-scale teaching assessment. It should be emphasized that the techniques used in AIClass are not the existing algorithms but creatively proposed to tackle the main challenges in real classroom environment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms and AIClass system. In the future, we will further correlate features extracted from classrooms, and build a more intelligent teaching assistance system."/>
